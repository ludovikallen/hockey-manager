# üèí Hockey Manager

## Overview

Hockey Manager is a mix between a turn-based strategy game and a hockey management simulation. Inspired by games like Civilization and Football Manager, it lets you take control of an NHL team and build a dynasty with it's own twist. Currently, the focus is on the local single player experience.
